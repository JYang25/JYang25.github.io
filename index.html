      <p><em>High-content screening across varied cells, conditions, and chemical libraries has emerged as a key method for identifying novel compounds capable of systematically perturbing a biological network to induce a phenotype. The molecular targets (proteins, receptors, etc.) through which these compounds act to achieve their phenotype(s) are typically unknown. I am currently developing a chemoinformatic approach using aspects of image processing, machine learning, and SEA to identify the targets of novel compounds via their phenotypic signature.</em></p>
